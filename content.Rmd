<b>Introduction to fisheries statistics in R</b>: an introduction to methods and tools available for common fisheries analyses in R, including length-frequency histograms, length-weight regression, growth curves, and proportional size distribution (PSD). Methods are demonstrated using base R functionality in addition to functions available through the `FSA` package for R (<a href="https://github.com/droglenc/FSA">Ogle et al. 2020</a>, <a>https://derekogle.com/fishR</a>). 

<b>Introduction to spatial data in R</b>: a (really basic) introduction to working with and plotting data commonly used in geographic information systems (GIS).
